# Mal-des-Vampirismus-TRA
This is an crude attempt to translate the mod Mal des Vampirismus v.1.3 for BG2:EE to English. 
The author of the mod, and the German version can be found here:
http://www.baldursgate-refugium.de/mods/mal-des-vampirismus/

The 1.1 version of the mod was available in English, but continued to receive substantial updates in German. I must admit, I barely understand the language and rely heavily on automation, but try to adapt all known variables correctly (attributes, stats and such).

This is bound to read awkardly in-game, but the point is mainly to implement the mechanics and fixes from the updated version.

I also have no idea how to do the things I'm doing.

Please refer to the website provided to get the changelog and a detailed description, albeit being in German.
 
DESCRIPTION:

The modification gives the player the opportunity to become a vampire in the course of the main quest of Shadows of Amn. The player must join Bodhi's guild. The choice to be turned into a vampire is voluntary and final. Once the player has been transformed, there is no going back.
